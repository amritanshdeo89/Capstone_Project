# Capstone_Project
predict_customers_next_purchase_day

## Project Info:

In this project I use the given datasets [Online Retail II UCI](https://www.kaggle.com/mashlyn/online-retail-ii-uci/download) available on [Kaggle](www.kaggle.com)., to give relevant answers to the following questions:

1. How many online customers are there in the dataset and what is their country of origin?

2. What are the countries that are most represented in the dataset?

3. Calculate the revenue that was made in each month and what is the percentage revenue based on countries?

4. Build a machine learning model to estimate if a given customer will buy something again from the online shop in the next quarter.
